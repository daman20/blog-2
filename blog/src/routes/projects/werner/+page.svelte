    <h3>How I got him</h3>
    <p>Named after the rocket scientist, my 2012 Audi A7 has seen some time. The same vehicle that took me to my third birthday now stands as my first car.</p>
    <br>
    <p>Upon receiving my license, I was informed that if I could repair the car, it would be mine. So, I got to work. </p>
    <h3> The Battery </h3>
    <p> The first issue was a dead battery. I replaced it with a new one, and the car started right up.</p>
    <h3> Misfires Galore </h3>
    <p>After ordering an OBD scanner, I found that there was a severe misfire in multiple cylinders. After some time on audizine.com, I began taking the engine as far out as I could. In the end, that repair required pulling the coolant tank, and replacing the spark plugs and ignition coils. </p>
    <br>
    <p>Great! I thought. And for a few months, it was great!</p>
    <h3> Free Straightpiping </h3>
    <p>Then, in September of 2024, I was driving back from a 3 hour basketball session, concluded with a thunderstorm (typical SFL). Coming out of a right turn, I saw a lightning strike a few hundred yards ahead of me, a loud bang (which may or may not have been thunder). All of the sudden, my car smelt like gas and sounded like an 18 wheeler. </p>
    <br>
    <p>Back to work I went. After crawling under the car (because I couldn’t find my jack stands), and getting stuck for a few minutes, I couldn’t seem to find the problem. So, I brought the car to a friends house, where 5 of the smartest people I know took a look.</p>
    <br>
    <p>Eventually, they discovered that the exhaust tubes had come unwelded from the flex pipes</p>
